# Exploring LLMs' Abiliity To Generate & Use Personal Contextual Data

![alt text](images/headers/banner.webp)

One of the most interesting use-cases for LLMs is their ability to leverage personal information in order to provide actionable guidance:

For example:

- Provided with a resume, an LLM can suggest opportunities for career advancement, upskilling, etc  
- Provided with your list of hobbies, an LLM can suggest opportunities to pursue those in a new city  
- Provided with your purchasing wishlist from Amazon, an LLM could suggest how you can optimise your budget to buy things you'll enjoy the most

As part of my wider interest in exploring LLMs (and open-sourcing the journey) I thought it would be interesting to share some of these. However, for obvious reasons, I can't freely disclose my own personal data. 

The solution that came to mind:

Using an LLM to generate an alias and using that alias to show how LLMs can do all of these things (and more).

"David Rosen" is loosely based around my own biography with minor details changed and some invented. All information related to this identity is fictitious.

Prompts and outputs documented here are shared purely with the intention that they might help others to explore how LLMs could be used for good when guided by small chunks of personal context.

## Repo Layout

The main part of the repo is `demos` which is where I log some prompts and outputs to try to highlight some of the potential use-cases. 

My focus is on synthesising well-written prompts (a work in progress!) and specific contextual data. I find that this formula can produce very interesting results that often far exceed, in utility, those which would be achieved without the added context.

I try to be as thorough as possible when documenting my various experiments with large language models (LLMs).

For that reason, I've added, to this repo, the prompts I used to construct the synthetic personal identity of 'David Rosen'. These are gathered in `development` to make them easy to distinguish from the prompts (and outputs) that demonstrate potential use-cases.
