# Prompt

Imagine that everything you may wish to know about a person could be compacted into a single folder called `data`.

We might imagine that the folder would have top-level subfolders called `professional` and `personal`.

This folder would consist of files which would record contextual information about that person's life.

For example, there might be a file called `hobbies`; one called `current job details`; another called `career aspirations`. 

Your task is to come up with 500 files. If you think that the `personal` and `professional`  structure is too constricting, use another one.

Structure your output in file tree notation.``
