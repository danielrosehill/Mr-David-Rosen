# Prompt

Imagine that everything you may wish to know about a person could be compacted into a single folder called `data`.

We might imagine that the folder would have top-level subfolders called `professional` and `personal`.

This folder would consist of files which would record contextual information about that person's life.

For example, there might be a file called `hobbies`; one called `current job details`; another called `career aspirations`. 

If you think that the `personal` and `professional`  structure is too constricting, use another one.

Your task is to come up with Python sript that will generate a directory structure with 500 such files.

In the script, use a variable called base_dir which the user hardcodes. The structure should be created in /data relative to the base.
