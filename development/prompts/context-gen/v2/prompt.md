Imagine that everything you may wish to know about a person could be compacted into a single folder on a computer.

Within that folder would be files, and each file would have a descriptive name.

Examples :


career-goals.md
life-mission.md
employment-history.md
childrens-names.md
place-of-birth.md

Generate a list of 200 file names, ordered alphabetically by the first character in the file name.
Output a list of names, each one on a separate line. Do not list numbers.
