Write a Python script

It should have a variable base_dir setting the base directory which the user can configure by hard-coding.

The script will create a list of context files (all with the extension.md) within /data relative to the base directory.

The list of files should be chosen according to the instructions above. 

In the script, explicitly provide the list of filenames to be generated.
