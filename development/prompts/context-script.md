# Prompt

Imagine that everything you may wish to know about a person could be compacted into a single folder on a computer.

Within that folder would be files, and each file would have a descriptive name.

Examples :

career-goals.md
life-mission.md
employment-history.md
childrens-names.md
place-of-birth.md

Generate a list of 1000 file names, ordered alphabetically by the first character in the file name.

They should be as realistic and descriptive as possible. There should be no duplicates/repetition.

Each filename should have the extension .md.
