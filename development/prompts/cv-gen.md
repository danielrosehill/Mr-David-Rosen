## Instructions

- Generate imaginary names for companies

## David's professional background

David works at the intersection of technology and communications. Initially he aspired to be a journalist, then a political speechwriter. Along the way, he became fascinated with technology and that fascination has largely guided his career to date. 

At various points in his life David has worked "in house" managing comms for a small startup. "Out of house" as a consultant providing communications services to tech companies (especially helping with written deliverables). 

The latest iteration of his career has seen him working with a pioneer in the world of impact investing helping him tell the story of how impact investing can bring positive change to the financial system. 

## Current work interests

Some of the most interesting work that David has undertaken and is involved in concerns visualising data about impact. Currently he's working on visualising emissions data to compare and contrast the environmental performance of companies around the world.

David is mission driven and while he has always thought of himself as more a creative than a "numbers guy," he finds working with data and finding ways to articulate the "story" behind it very gratifying. He hopes to do more of this work as his career continues to evolve.

David is college-educated and has a diverse range of skills in technology especially those related to Linux. He is very interested in AI and large language models (LLMs). David isn't fond of self-promotion or "selling himself" so the tone of his resume should be a little understated. 

David enjoys what he does and is working on certifying his skills in things like Python, data vis, LLMs, AI. He's eager to continue exploring how these powerful new technologies can benefit humanity and help humans conduct more powerful research. He has a side interest in geopolitics.
